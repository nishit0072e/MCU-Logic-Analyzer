- STM32F103C6Tx MCU features DMA
- PORT_A of GPIO Bank is Utilized (PA0 - PA7)
- 2KB Smapling Buffer
- Arduino Framework (HAL Based)
- Python Qt5 Based GUI
- Real time Capture of Data
- When Bit samples fill the sample buffer, the DMA parse the samples to PC via UART
- Because of UART, GUI feels little Laggy
